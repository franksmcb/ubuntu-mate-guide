<title>1.01 So You've Discovered Linux!</title>

<p><media type="image" src="apps/tux_small.png" width="32"/> </p>

<p>Once you become aware that there is dependable, secure, capable, and modern software to run your computer that rivals all others in popularity and actual use, you will want to try the <link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</link> operating system. Perhaps you've been using a member of the Unix/Linux family - Linux, Android, ChromeOS, BSD or even macOS - for quite a while. If so, you are likely looking for new ways to optimize your technology for the way you work.</p>

<p>You've likely switched to Linux to be able to use software that is like your previous computer's software, only better. By "better" you probably mean a modern but familiar user experience design, easy to understand and use, designed with security built-in, and protection from viruses and spyware included. You want all of that included and upgradeable at no additional charge. You want it all to "just work" with minimal or no maintenance -- automatic security updates and software upgrades for both the operating system and all of your installed applications. You don't mind paying for software, but you prefer the "try before you buy" philosophy. Ubuntu MATE gives you all of that and more!</p>

<p>While it's is great for users who have migrated from Windows or macOS, Ubuntu MATE is also an excellent choice for any kind of computer user, from casual home user to professional software developer. That's because of its modern, functionally thought-out design. Ubuntu MATE is capable enough for even the most experienced computer user because, well, it's Linux! It has the power of every other Linux built-in. Simply put, it provides a practical alternative to other software that can run on your computer.</p>

<p>With that in mind, this guide is written from the perspective that Ubuntu MATE is a typical modern Linux for the average computer user. Let's assume that our fictional "average user" is someone who needs to browse the Internet, check email, use a text editor or word processor, and maybe read and store document files. Let's also include viewing and editing photos, watching videos, listening to music, and subscribing to podcasts. Whether you are new to Linux, upgrading from Windows or macOS to Linux, or just thinking about moving to Linux, this documentation will provide you with practical, day-to-day guidance on how you can use Ubuntu MATE and its applications. This is a guide for new users and a reference for all users of Linux.</p>

<title>Why Users Switch from Windows</title>

<p>In addition to common and well-founded concerns around security, we often get questions and comments from Windows users who have become more and more dissatisfied with Microsoft's operating system. It seems that after purchasing and installing a new version, or more likely purchasing a new computer with the upgraded operating system pre-installed, those users are finding that they have to repurchase a newer version of the same software applications they already own, just to have it work with the upgraded version of Windows. Switching to online, cloud-based software applications might at first seem to be a practical alternative, but those applications are often less capable and at least as expensive, especially after a year or more of paying monthly subscription fees. To add insult to injury, Windows users sometimes also have to pay for new accessories like printers and security cameras to replace perfectly functioning older models that require software that is no longer compatible with the 'upgraded' version of the operating system. Because of all this, that promise of a 'free upgrade' from Windows 7 or 8 to Windows 10 has, in fact, turned out to be anything but free. In fact, it can be just as expensive as previous Windows upgrades have been.</p>

<title>Why Users Switch from macOS</title>

<p>Switching to Apple's macOS (formerly OSX) doesn't get you off of the treadmill of forking over more and more cash for software and hardware upgrades. If anything, it accelerates that treadmill. Apple's recent direction with its products seems to continue the trend of ever- more expensive products that eliminate as many of its printer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and other accessory ports as possible. Expensive dongles and adapters must be moneymakers for Apple. They've also been sealing shut the computer's case on newer models, eliminating the possibility of replacing or upgrading on your own simple things like RAM, hard drives, and broken parts.</p>

<title>Ubuntu MATE Works for You, Not the Other Way Around</title>

<p>Neither Microsoft nor Apple will let you upgrade that perfectly-functioning computer hardware you purchased a few years ago, even though it has almost the same specs as the newest computers available today. You are told it 'isn't capable' of running modern software. Insultingly, your Windows computer that is supposedly incapable of running more modern software keeps trying to force you to upgrade to the incompatible version! Perhaps you'd rather learn how to optimize Linux than hunt down one more Windows hack or workaround to prevent your computer from doing the things it wants to do -- but you don't want it to be doing. Maybe you just want to use your computer to get things done. Maybe you believe your computer should be doing work for you, and not the other way around. Ubuntu MATE is designed to make all of that a reality!</p>
