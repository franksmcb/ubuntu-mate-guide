With modest hardware requirements it is suitable for modern workstations, single board computers and older hardware alike. Ubuntu MATE makes modern computers fast and old computers usable.</p>

    <item> • on most of the world's fastest and most powerful supercomputers</item>
    <item> • on many of, if not most of, the computers that make up the backbone of Internet</item>
    <item> • and on corporate servers that require stability and reliability</item>
  </item>

<p>The Ubuntu MATE operating system is more secure, and better supported than the operating system pre-installed on most home computer hardware today.</p>

<p>Using Ubuntu MATE provides you with the freedom to run a complete, full-featured operating system, pre-configured with most (if not all) of the applications you will need for your daily computing. Change anything about the way it looks, the way it works, or the applications it runs to suit your taste.</p>
